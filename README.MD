# Flights Design
In an attempt to strengthen my design skills, I began reading [RefactoringUI](https://refactoringui.com/). I did my best to recreate the styled flights page as an exercise in html/css.

Check out the site [here](https://clirette.github.io/flights-design/). (Note that responsive design is not yet implemented)
